# What is Version Control?

## Definition
Version Control is a system that **tracks changes in files over time** so that you can:
- See previous versions
- Restore old changes
- Work safely with others

In simple words:
> Version control remembers every change you make to your files.

---

## Why Version Control Is Needed
Without version control:
- Files get overwritten
- No history of changes
- No safe collaboration
- Hard to fix mistakes

With version control:
- Every change is saved
- You can go back anytime
- Multiple people can work together

---

## Real-Life Example
Google Docs:
- Auto-saves changes
- Shows version history
- Allows rollback

Git does the same for **code**.

---

## What Version Control Tracks
- File changes
- Line-by-line differences
- Time of change
- Author of change
- Reason for change

---

## Types of Version Control Systems

### 1. Local Version Control
- Stored only on one computer
- No collaboration

### 2. Centralized Version Control
- One central server
- Everyone depends on it
- Server failure = work stops

### 3. Distributed Version Control
- Every user has full copy
- Works offline
- Very fast and secure

Git uses **Distributed Version Control**.

## Summary
Version control is the foundation of modern software development and collaboration.
