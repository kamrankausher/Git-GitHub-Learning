# What is Git?

## Definition
Git is a **distributed version control system** used to track changes in files and coordinate work between multiple people.

In simple words:
> Git remembers every change you make to your project and allows you to go back in time safely.

---

## What Git Is NOT
- Git is NOT GitHub
- Git is NOT only for programmers
- Git is NOT an online tool

Git runs **locally on your computer**.

---

## Why Git Is Needed
Git helps you to:
- Track file changes
- Recover deleted or broken code
- Experiment without fear
- Collaborate with others
- Maintain clean project history

---

## How Git Works (High-Level)
Git works by creating **snapshots** of your project instead of saving full copies.

Each snapshot:
- Has a unique ID
- Stores only changes
- Is permanent and secure

---

## Where Git Lives
Git lives:
- Inside your project folder
- In a hidden `.git` directory

When you run:


git init
Git creates .git and starts tracking the project.

## When You Should Use Git

Use Git when:

-You start any project

-You write notes or documentation

-You work with a team

-You want backup + history

## Key Benefits of Git

-Fast

-Offline support

-Secure history

-Powerful branching

-Industry standard

## Summary

Git is the backbone of modern development and the foundation for collaboration tools like GitHub.
